# Weather App 🌤️

A simple, lightweight GUI weather app that shows the current weather for any place. Enter a city and the app fetches and displays up-to-the-moment data such as temperature, feels-like temperature, humidity, wind speed, weather condition.

## Features
- Instant current-weather lookup for a specified location
- Clear, minimal graphical interface for quick reading
- Temperature (Celsius/Fahrenheit), humidity, wind speed, condition, and icon
- Basic error handling for invalid locations or network issues
- API key support

## Quick usage
- Run the application (main_file.py)
- Enter a city name and request the weather
- View the returned conditions.

## Implementation notes
- Implemented in Python with a lightweight GUI framework (Tkinter) and an HTTP client (requests)
- Requires a weather API (for example OpenWeatherMap) and an API key to fetch live data
- Keep API keys out of source control and configurable via environment variables or a config file

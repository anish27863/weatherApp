# Problem Statement

Many users need fast, accurate, and user-friendly access to real-time weather information for any city worldwide. Existing solutions are often slow or confusing, making it harder to obtain reliable weather data quickly. This project aims to create a desktop application that utilizes a simple, intuitive graphical interface to display essential weather metrics for any specified city using live data from the OpenWeatherMap API.[1][5]

# Scope of the Project

- This application focuses on providing real-time weather data, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief condition description, for any city entered by the user.[5][1]
- The scope includes:
  * Development of a graphical user interface (GUI) using Python's Tkinter module.
  * Integration with OpenWeatherMap API for fetching current weather details.
  * Basic error handling for invalid search input and network/API errors.
  * User experience optimized for clarity, speed, and responsiveness.
- The application is intended to run on mainstream desktop platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS), requiring only Python and internet access for operation.

# Target Users

- Urban residents and travelers wishing to plan activities based on local weather.
- Students and professionals who need quick weather updates.
- Anyone seeking a simple desktop tool to check weather information for various cities.

# High-Level Features

- City search bar with placeholder hint and input validation.
- Real-time weather fetching from OpenWeatherMap API.
- Display of current temperature, feels-like temperature, humidity%, wind speed, and condition.
- Responsive user interface with visual feedback for errors and successful searches.
- Modular codebase supporting future enhancements (e.g., multi-day forecasts, favorite cities).[1][5]
